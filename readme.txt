== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can it be used on live site ? =
This plugin is only meant to be used for development purposes, but shouldn't cause any issues if run on a production site.


= What are post types ? =
>WordPress can hold and display many different types of content. A single item of such a content is generally called a post, although post is also a specific post type. Internally, all the post types are stored in the same place, in the wp_posts database table, but are differentiated by a column called post_type.
>
>WordPress 3.0 gives you the capability to add your own custom post types and to use them in different ways.
